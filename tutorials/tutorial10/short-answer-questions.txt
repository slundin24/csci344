Please answer the following two questions:

1. What is a join (just in your own words) and why is it useful?

- A join is a way to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column. It's useful because it can pull together information from multiple tables into a single result set. It's also useful for when you need to retrieve data that spans more than one table.


2. Consider the structure of the posts table: why would you want to use a foreign key (user_id) to the users table instead of storing the username, first_name, and last_name in the posts table?

- We use a foreign key to avoid duplicating user information in every post record. Storing just the user_id in the posts table and joining it with the users table is more efficient and ensures data consistency.
